## wallpaper-changer-gnome
A 100% bash script that changes the wallpaper and the screensaver in a GNOME desktop environment.

1. Download the image of the day from Bing.
2. Set it as wallpaper in GNOME.
3. Open a dialog to ask if the user like the wallpaper, otherwise fall to a random one in the folder.

To make it change the wallpaper daily, just add it as a Startup Application in a UNIX env.

Heavily inspired by other similar applications like [bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension](https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension)
